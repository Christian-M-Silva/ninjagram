## Overview

### The objectives

- Create an API where you can register, delete, view a comment, only if you are registered and logged in
### How to run the project

  After downloading the application to your machine, run it in the terminal:
  ```bash
    npm i 
    # or:
    yarn
  ```

  After successful installation of all packages, run in terminal:
  ```bash

  **Go to the env file and make the necessary settings. By default this project is in mongo, if you change the database, go to *APP >> CONFIG >> DATABASE* and change the connection to the desired database, don't forget to download the right package, see more in the adonis documentation.**

  **See the route file to know where to open it, you can also base yourself on the insomnia document**
